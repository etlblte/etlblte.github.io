### Goal
> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**

### Solution
We can check how many lines this file has by using the command `wc --lines`. 

```bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ wc --lines data.txt 
# 98567 data.txt
```

It looks like there's almost 100,000 lines the word could be on! That would require a lot of time to go through manually. Luckily we can use the command `grep` to search for a string within a file.  The format for this command is `grep what where`. Here's how we can use it:

```
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep millionth data.txt 
# millionth	dfw...
```

### Summary
This challenge showed us how we can use the `grep` command to see if a file contains a certain word or string of data. This is useful for searching through the contents of files.
