### Goal
> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

### Solution
Previously we have used `cat` to read the contents of files; however, what can we do if the data is not readable? For instance, we can check the first few lines of data using the `head` command:

```bash
bandit9@bandit:~$ file data.txt 
# data.txt: data
bandit9@bandit:~$ head data.txt 
# ��4aSSW�ҭ��j�s�E���K4���,��l0@P(��gw�)����2�l�BJ�
# ��������|Y������@����-�-t=�]�bڊ�˯���N8�k��zR|?K�(Vbj�6F)��Wg&�<u�5� # ^�k���r�$�)
```

As we can see there is a lot of unreadable data contained in the file. Luckily there is another command that is useful in this scenario. The command `strings` will only show the printable characters in a file. We can use this here to find the human-readable strings within `data.txt`. In the description, the password is said to be stored next to several '=' characters. So, we can combine the `strings` command with the `grep` command to search for the printable characters and filter for those including '=':

```bash
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep =
# ,k=?
# @k*=
# ========== the
# #e=in
# g+=ypF
# ea=+
# K>=*<
# ========== password{k
# =========== is
# 1R=j/
# e=<2g%
# +G/YD=
# =wDk
# =3?lOt
# ========== FG...
# =D!f
# H =sS
```

### Summary
In this challenge we learned how the `strings` command can be used to display the human-readable contents of a file.
